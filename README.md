# Type 2 diabetes Diagonosis tool:
The topic for this project is the chronich illness of Diabetes mellitus, commonly known as Diabetes.
Goals:
> To develop a tool that could assess profesionals in determining the diagnosis of Type II Diabetes. This illness typically develops at middle age, with mild symptoms at the beginning, hindering an early diagnosis.

> A specific objective within building such a tool, is to explore the possibility of predicting pre-diabetes. Pre-diabetes is a reversible stage in the development of Diabetes illness.

> To stablish the most influencing factors in diabetes development, and their impact in building a model for diagnosis. Is it possible to reach a good result selecting only attributes with the most impact?

> To test the model and use it with some real data.

The used dataset is diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015.csv, a clean dataset of 253 680 survey responses to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2015, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). CDC is the USA’s leading science-based, data-driven, service organization that protects the public’s health.
The dataset is compound of 22 variables, of which Diabetes_012 can be considered the target variable. Values for this Diabetes_012 variable consist of 3 classes:

   - 0 is for no diabetes or only during pregnancy,
   - 1 is for prediabetes,
   - and 2 is for diabetes.
